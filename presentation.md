# Hackathon like something

- `4 hours.`
- Provides spec and screen mocks
- Retake is okay. (other subjects)
- `Hardcode mode.`

---

1:00 (7:00)
# Example

- Spec is simple, but checking learned skills.
```
- Voting.
- BBS extention.
- Like-list like bookmarking.
```

- No decorations.

1:00 (8:00)
# Approach

- Specify issue -> solution simply.
- Write spec / screenflow / UML fit to me.
```Paper and pen.```
- Then try to coding.
- Deployment to AWS from scratch. ```not Heroku```

	- Reviewing, split big work for small one.
