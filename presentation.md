# Bootcamp

```
Mainly Learning How To Learn.

The interview is mandatory on most on-site.

The algorithm is a big issue. (Make it fun, it's cheap)
 11:00-12:30 every day.

It's time to practice terminal essentials, algorithm, 
 and using other gears.

```Paper and pen.```

- Deployment and test on AWS. ```(not Heroku)``` (1.0h)
